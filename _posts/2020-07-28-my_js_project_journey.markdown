As with every project thus far, creating my JavaScript, Instantgram application, was challenging at first but ultimately extremely rewarding.
Personally, I've noticed how working on projects such as these helps me connect all the dots that lessons past have taught me. I remember how insecure I was with my rails project and how difficult and isolating it felt to work on it. The Javascript project forced me to reevaluate my outlook on working on my own. Instead of whining and moaning about how difficult it was to be working on projects alone, I got sick of that spent energy which left me with nothing but a sense of dread and self-loathing. Instead, I did what I should have done a long, LONG time ago and left my frustrations at the door and put my investigative cap on. Whenever a bug would arise I would first look at the neighboring code and any other code that may have been dependent on the bug to see if everything looked good. Then I would scope out, see if all the other pieces were working. Did my serializer have all necessary attributes to load data I wanted to display? Was I properly fetching to the correct URI's according to my rails routes? How did my config/routes.rb look? Etc. 
This attitude not only made me so much more efficient at debugging, it also left me more confident every time I found the problem. 
Of course there were times when I needed a fresh pair of eyes to take a look at my code so I asked around for help. 
What was different this time around was I did absolutely everything I could to get something to work. For an embarrassingly long time, I wouldn't have it in me to look up documentation. I felt paralyzed looking at complex code and functions. I wouldn't have patience parsing through the noise until I found what I was looking for. I didn't have the energy to take the time to understand what the complicated bits were saying. 
It all changed. As soon as I wasn't getting answers from people, I understood that I had the most power. If no one was going to help me, I had to help myself, and it left me feeling independent which is an amazing feeling. For the help that I did receive it was very much appreciated!
Thank you to everyone who helped me along the way and I'm looking forward to finishing up the course!
