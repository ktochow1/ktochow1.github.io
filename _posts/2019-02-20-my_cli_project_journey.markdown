Starting my CLI project was more tedious than actually working on it.
I must have spent a few days thinking about thinking about what to do.
I finally settled on scraping job reviews off of Indeed.com. 
My project was heavily influenced by Jennifer Hansen's Dealio CLI application.
If you haven't already seen it, I highly recommend it, especially if you get panicked 
when staring at a blank text editor. 
One of my biggest hurdles was making sure that the end of my code flowed nicely when
the user was prompted to select whether or not they wanted to explore more job reviews after their initial run-through. 
After trying different ways to make the interaction between user and application flow, my code became a huge knot and 
untying it would prove to be easier than I thought. At first, I began moving around methods to different classes, and providing case statements on top of case statements, and it made my code ugly and confusing to follow. 
The "problem" was in my control flow logic. By switching up a few case statements to check user input in the correct order, I was able to make everything run smoothy. 
Overall, working on this project was a bit challenging in the beginning, but the amount of resources that are provided,
and the encouragement I got from coaches and other students helped build my self-confidence. Coding can easily become an isolating activity, especially when you're working on something alone at home. But through screensharing with coaches and students, watching videos of teachers explaining concepts that you're more comfortable with and some students still struggle with, gives you a sense of community and empowerment. Before this project I used to be extremely stressed about the amount of knowledge I didn't know, but after making this app, as primitive as it is, it proved to me that I do know enough to build something. Seeing my app work empowered me immensely and only made me more motivated to learn more.
