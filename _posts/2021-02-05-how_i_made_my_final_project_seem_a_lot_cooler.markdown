It's embarrassing to admit, but I had a LOT of trouble using PostgreSQL. 
There were installation issues that made me reconfigure my cache files. I had to 
reinstall it more times than I'm willing to share, but once I finally got it up and running,
I was so confused. PG Admin 4 (the GUI version of PostgreSQL) did not seem
intuative to me and documentation/posts on how to use it didn't help me much. 
I think I spent a little more than a week until I gave up and reverted back to my beloved sqlite3 database.
Since my lost battle with postgreSQL my ego was shattered and I felt like I needed to step it up.

I decided to build an e-commerce website, and I knew that I wanted to use a third party authentication system using Google when I stumbled upon Google's Firebase SDK.
Firebase is a Google platform that has a lot of utilities to choose from. From authentication to cloud database storage, to hosting and machine learning, it's a powerhouse of must-have tools any developer can take advantage of. 
Firebase allows you to authenticate your users through their Gmail accounts among other ways. Sign in through Google? Sure! Facebook? Yep! Twitter? Absolutely! Phone / email? Yes and Yes. And there are more methods to choose from.
It's an extremely well documented source and it was a pleasure to work with. That's not to say that it was easy. It's well documented but there's A LOT of documentation to parse and experiment with. Nonetheless, it's super powerful and I will most likely use it again in future solo projects. 

In addition to my own API, I worked with Stripe's API. It turns out that React has a Stripe Checkout extension that makes using Stripe a lot easier when building apps with React. After some reading and configuring, I got a seemingly impressive cart checkout function that handles collecting user data and credit card information.

All in all, I'm really proud with how my app came out. It's not perfect but I'll see what else I can do to make it even cooler.
