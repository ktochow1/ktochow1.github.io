Upon finishing college as an undergraduate, I ended school with a degree in a field 
I didn't really feel like persuing. When I was still in school, I met a girl who was a brilliant, 
passionate computer science major. I remember her showing me pages and pages of code
she'd been working on and I was instantly intrigued. She explained to me that coding was more
of a language than math equations. By the time I learned about this, I was too late into switching
my major and too intimidated to take college level classes I know I wouldn't do well in. So, I plodded
along with my sociology studies and kept tinkering with code on the side. 

Growing up, I was always impulsive and my passions were all sudden and short-lived. For whatever
reason, coding has stayed on my mind for more than a few years and I'm glad it has. For once I have
something to be ambitious about, and I feel incredibly lucky that found I something that I'll devote my career to. 

Coding is not easy, and I've struggled quite a bit. But once I get my programs to work and run smoothly
there's no feeling like it.
